## ✨ **Insights Summary – GST Revenue Analysis (2017–2025)**



1. ### Top-performing states dominate national GST collection



* ###### Around five industrially strong states — primarily Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana — contribute a major share of India’s total GST revenue.
* ###### This indicates a concentration of manufacturing and trade activity in a few regions.



### 2\. Peak GST collections occur in March, April, and January



* ###### The surge corresponds to financial year closings, invoice settlements, and compliance adjustments.
* ###### This pattern highlights seasonal revenue behavior, useful for budget forecasting and policy timing.



### 3\. Post–GST 2.0 period shows uneven revenue response across states



* ###### Despite reduced slabs for essential goods, some states show stagnant or declining GST growth — suggesting that price reductions may not have translated to higher sales volumes.
* ###### Possible explanation: corporate margin inflation, where companies retained the benefit instead of lowering prices for consumers.



### 4\. Industrial vs. consumption-driven state behavior differs



* ###### Industrial states (Maharashtra, Haryana, Karnataka) show higher IGST collections due to strong inter-state trade.
* ###### Consumption-heavy states (Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat) exhibit higher SGST and CGST, driven by local purchases and retail demand.



### 5\. Revenue imbalance reveals potential compliance or reporting gaps



* ###### Some regions consistently underperform compared to GDP contribution, indicating possible tax evasion, reporting inefficiencies, or weaker compliance mechanisms.

### 

### 6\. Policy-level implication



* ###### If reduced slabs were intended to boost consumption, then stable or declining GST in certain states is a red flag — requiring investigation into pricing practices and sales reporting.
