# GST-Analysis-Power-BI-Project
🧭 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze the impact of GST 2.0 — a reform that reduced tax slabs for essential goods — and to create awareness about how such policy changes affect both citizens and government revenue.
The dashboard helps identify state-wise GST collection trends, exposing cases where corporations might be profiting from tax reductions without passing the benefits to consumers. It also supports data-driven decision-making for government officials to detect irregularities and improve tax monitoring.

📊 Data / Problem Handled

The project uses GST revenue data from 2017 to 2025, sourced from the National Data & Analytics Platform (NDAP).
The data includes:

Monthly and yearly GST collections

State-wise revenue details

Components of tax: CGST, SGST, IGST, and Cess

The main analytical challenge was to track trends and deviations in revenue growth, especially during the GST 2.0 period, to understand whether reduced slabs led to increased consumption or corporate margin inflation.

✨ Outcomes & Key Insights

Top 5 states contribute the majority of India’s GST revenue.

March, April, and January show peak collections due to fiscal cycles.

Industrial states (like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana) show higher IGST due to inter-state trade.

Consumption-heavy states (like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh) show more SGST/CGST revenue.

The dashboard enables state-wise revenue comparison, helping detect regions where expected post-reform growth did not occur — a potential signal of margin exploitation or policy inefficiency.
